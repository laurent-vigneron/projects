# Perfect Tic-Tac-Toe

## Introduction

The purpose of this project was to implement the Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
Note that the notion of pruning and depth are not really that useful in this particular case, since the game is simple enough for all states to be navigated easily.
The Game will reset 3 seconds after a conclusion is reached (spoiler alert: you won't win, but you may be able to secure a tie). During a game reset, there is a 50/50 chance that the CPU will start the next game.
